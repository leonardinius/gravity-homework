# Gravity team coding task 

## Description.

- [ ] Use binance rest and/or websocket api.
- [ ] Keep track of BTC/USDT pair.
- [ ] For both sides (bid and ask) calculate at what price you should place an order, so that with 50% probability it would be filled in next 10 seconds.
- [ ] Each 10 seconds print out these prices and best bid, best ask price.
- [x] Use python language.
- [ ] Add tests.

## What gets evaluated.

- Algorithm efficiency.
- Algorithm correctness.
- Code cleanness.
